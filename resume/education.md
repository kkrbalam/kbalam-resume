### MS in Electrical and Computer Engineering

* School: [SDSM&T](https://www.sdsmt.edu), Rapid City, SD, USA
* Years: 2003-2005
* GPA: 4.00

> I have come to the US in 2003 to pursue my masters in Electrical and Computer Engineering with specialization in Very Large Scale Integrated Circuits (VLSI) from South Dakota School of Mines and Technology. Initially it was very diffcult to adopt to teaching techniques followed here, but with help from my mentor and other faculty memebers I was able to overcome these difficulties and graduate with 4.00 GPA. I was able to gain very deep understanding of computer architecture, semi-conductor design and manufacturing processes, Digital Signal Processing, FPGA programming and Nural Networks and Fuzzy logic.

### B.Tech in Electronics and Communications Engineering

* School: [SNIST](https://www.sreenidhi.edu.in), Hyderabad, India
* Years: 1999 - 2003
* GPA: 3.25

> After my high school, in 1999, I went on to join one of the best engineering schools in the region, Sree Nidhi Institute of Science and Technology. I went on to choose electronics and comunications engineering as my major due to my profound interest and fascination towards computers and other electronics devices. I have completed my bachelors with more enthusiasm and eagerness learn about the field.
