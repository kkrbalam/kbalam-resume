[Qimonda](http://www.qimonda.com) designs semiconductor memory technologies, as well as develops, manufactures, markets, and sells various semiconductor memory products on a chip, component, and module level.

I have joined a semiconductor manufacturing company called Qimonda NA in May 2008, thinking that my course work in Electrical Engineering and my experience in computer science is a perfect combination for an exciting experience.

### Manufacturing Business Intelligence Practice

- **Duration:** May 2008 - March 2009
- **Capacity:** Sr. Information Systems Engineer
- **Division:** Manufacturing Business Intelligence

> Hired as a Sr. Information Systems Engineer to be a part of manufacturing business intelligence team, my role was to manage and guide a team of Junior Information Systems Engineers, to design a new near real-time replication mechanism between factory transaction databases and data warehouse, design and develop master data management initiatives, employ Lean Six Sigma methodology in data warehouse design, development and maintenance activities, 24X7 support for Data Warehouses and as well as custom designed reporting applications.

> My responsibilities included applying my deep experience in database and data warehouse development to provide low latency near real-time insights for line managers all over the globe as well as upper management to effectively manage and reduce glitches in manufacturing. I also had the responsibility of providing a master data repository to all business units around the world for process parameters to streamline new product development.

##### Key Accomplishments

- Implemented near real-time data replication process (using Oracle MV logs and fast refresh) to migrate data from factory databases into enterprise data warehouse to provide near real-time insights for manufacturing line managers about the status and thereby reducing the number of manufacturing line stoppages by 75%.

- Provided data governance capabilities, improved data quality, by implementing a master data repository called FIPS (fabrication incorporates planning and simulation) to standardize process parameters across all factories around the world to streamline the new product manufacturing process and to reduce time to market.

-  Integrated data from factory databases and ERP systems spread across the world and provided reports and dashboards with manufacturing intelligence to a wide variety of business units.
